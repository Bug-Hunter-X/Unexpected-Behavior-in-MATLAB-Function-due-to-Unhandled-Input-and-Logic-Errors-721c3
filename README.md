This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB. The function `myFunction.m` contains subtle logic issues and lacks comprehensive error handling, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution (`bugSolution.m`) rectifies these issues using improved input validation and more robust error handling. The error is difficult to identify through basic testing and requires a deeper understanding of MATLAB's error handling mechanisms and potential edge cases.
